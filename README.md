## CRAS Agenda📝

#### Our aim is to increase engagement in cognitive science. This is a collaborative learning environment designed to help you gain confidence when engaging in academic discussions.

So please note, this is a society for anyone who is interested in cognitive science. This society is fun specifically because it attracts people with naturally different knowledge and ideas, sparking interesting conversations! After-all, we need discrepancies in understanding for teaching and learning.

#### Overall aims and objectives:

  

- Create a supportive space for cognitively-interested members of the university to help each other on their learning journeys and express their passion for cognitive science together!

  

- Help members develop academic skills including critical thinking, theoretical knowledge and conceptual articulation; as well as soft skills including confidence in public speaking and collaboration.

  

- Encourage those interested in pursuing a professional identity as a cognitive researcher. 

  

#### Specific activities:

  

- Each fortnight, we meet on-campus to discuss a designated research article. We rotate who chooses this paper on a volunteer basis. It is the responsibility of this person to provide a brief overview and rationale for their selection at the meet.

- CRAS symposiums in which all members have the opportunity to present a short talk relating to an overarching theme.

-  Organised visits to researcher-led symposiums to help aspiring academics gain insight and build connections.
